**In-House Coding Challenge**

Welcome! The purpose of this exercise is to get a feel for your coding style and overall approach to development. You don't need to finish all the tasks, but do time yourself so you complete what you can within the span of an hour. 
Now the housekeeping: 
- To begin, please clone this repository. 
- When you’re done with the exercise, please create a .zip file with everything we’d need to run your implementation to hello @weareinhouse.com
- Finally, we strive to keep this fair and objective. Please do not include any identifying information as part of the content file you send. The files will be anonymized before being presented to the people responsible for evaluating the work.

Ok, now that we have all that out of the way...
There are several areas on which we'll be focusing our evaluation:

1. **D3.JS**
 - You will find a LineChart component. This component is incomplete. You must fix any errors / incomplete portions in order for the LineChart to render correctly based on the data provided on the same file.
 - Bonus points: It’d be awesome if the LineChart component could be responsive.

2. **REACT.JS**
 - Throughout the challenge you'll be expected to code using ES6

3. **React-Redux**
 - We've added some actions we think you'll find easy to implement. Feel free to add as many as you'd like.
4. **General ability to implement design**
